My mom's so creative and has such fun with words. Recently I shared this post on the suffix `le` with her:

She got inspired. Turns out the OED lists many more meanings for `le`. She wrote an le-heavy short stort for my kindergartener DC1. We read it aloud without the l's,  DC1 filled in the missing ls, and DC2 read it out loud. It was funny to read it out loud without the `ls` and my kids were delighted at the mention of the coracle since we'd recently read a funny description of a horrible coracle ride in Daniel Pinkwater's "Adventures of a catwhiskered girl" (DC2: "nana, your story got it wrong; you can't point a coracle!").

A tru(ffl)e story


Under a sky full of twink_ing stars, a man grabbed his fishing pole and wrigg_ed into his corac_e. Moonbeams spark_ed on the water, and the breeze ruff_ed his hair. The boat was easy to hand_e; he padd_ed nimb_y toward the island. On the island, a gagg_e of geese was sleeping, their heads nest_ed under their wings. One gabb_ed softly in its sleep. 

Something rust_ed and shuff_ed in the underbrush – the man’s spine ting_ed. Was this the famous snagg_e-toothed boar that could nuzz_e his snout into the earth and snuff_e out truff_es? Though many had tried, no one had ever been able to wrang_e this beast off the island. The man had a plan: he dang_ed a small bund_e of truff_es from his fishing pole. The beast came closer and closer, sniffing the air. The man pointed his corac_e away from the island, toward the shore, and padd_ed slowly. The pig crink_ed his eyes shut, wrink_ed his snout, followed the truff_e scent, and soon, he was swimming.  

When the corac_e reached the shore, the man jumped out and lured the boar into a large pen. “Here, Pigg_e, Pigg_e, Pigg_e . . .” This was his plan: He and the snagg_e-toothed boar would hunt truff_es together. He would pedd_e the truff_es, and  make a bood_e of money. He and the boar would go back to the island whenever they needed a break. He’d take a duff_e bag full of waff_es and truff_es in the corac_e, and they would romp and feast with the gagg_e of geese. 

Would the plan work? It was worth a gamb_e.
