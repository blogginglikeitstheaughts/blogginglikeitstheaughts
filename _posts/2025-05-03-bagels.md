They were fairly low effort! I adapted this [recipe](https://rachaellsrecipes.com/small-batch-sourdough-bagels/):

- added 1 extra fl oz water because i like high moisture dough and i live high alittude
- almost iddn't knead at all
- flour mix included about 1 oz dark rye and some diatastic malt (a couple spoons?)
-
