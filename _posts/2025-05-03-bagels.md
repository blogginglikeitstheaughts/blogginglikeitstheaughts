They were fairly low effort! I adapted this [recipe](https://rachaellsrecipes.com/small-batch-sourdough-bagels/).

Notes:

- i really like small batch because large batch 1. feels like a lot of work and 2. results in leftover bagels that i freeze, then forget about. These, I just baked in the toaster oven.
- added 1 extra fl oz water because i like high-moisture dough and i live high alittude
- almost didn't knead at all
- as always, ignored rise times. they were on the counter for most of a day, then in the fridge overnight, then the kids helped me shape them in the AM.
- flour mix included about 1 oz dark rye and some diastatic malt powder (a couple spoons?)
